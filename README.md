## Universal Gitcoin Grants for the Raiden Network

### Build (d)apps on the Raiden Network

#### Receive grants worth USD 2-10k for building (d)apps on the Raiden Network

The Raiden Network is a decentralised off-chain payments network for the Ethereum blockchain and allows developers to build faster, cheaper and more scalable (d)apps. brainbot labs is offering grants for developers to build on or integrate their (d)apps with the Raiden Network. 

#### What is the Raiden Network?
We are inviting Dapp projects as well as independent developers to build their application for (end) users based on the Raiden protocol. We believe that the Raiden Network is most useful for applications that rely on payments or token transfers, because currently it is the only Ethereum L2 solution that enables linear scalability, low latency and low fees at the same time, while being decentralized. 


#### Scope
The Raiden Network team has abstracted away many of the technical complexities so that developers can build scalable decentralized applications on a simple API. 

#### Some example use-cases include:
* Back-end payment networks for wallets
* Paywalls and internet tipping
* A tip bot for social platforms (e.g. twitter, reddit) or chat bot for micropayments (e.g. telegram)
* A payments network for file-sharing protocols
* Building a game on Raiden
* A demo of a permissionless sharing economy app (bike/ride/whatever)
* Better onboarding experience
 
#### Requirements:
* In order to be eligible for Raiden Network Grant payouts, the following aspects will be considered: 
* Code needs to be published under an open source license
* General Quality and UX of the technical implementation
* Complexity of the implementation
* Soundness of the use case or application

Relevancy: Projects should be relevant to the Raiden ecosystem, meaning that they should provide value to end users and be centered around actual use cases. They should be “safe” and any potential risks to end users should be clearly and fully stated. 

In addition, the general quality of the submission will be considered. 

Preferably, the project should cover a use case that can only be solved using the unique properties of the Raiden Network. 

#### How to apply:
To make sure that your submission will be considered as adding value to the Raiden Network ecosystem, please submit a project proposal beforehand to get feedback:

* Create a [new issue](https://github.com/raiden-network/grants/issues) with the name of your project in our grants repo
* Outline your proposal in that issue including the use case and functionality (300-800 words)
* Please include an estimated effort so that we can decide on a fitting grant size (more funds will be added to the grant on gitcoin in case of a more complex submisison)
* Await feedback to make sure that what you’re building is meaningful

### How to submit your final project:
When you have finished your work on a project, please provide the following information in order to be considered for a grant payout:

* A link to the open-source repository containing all the code associated with your project
* Clear instructions on how to setup and run your project
* A video demo of your project

After your final submission has been made, the brainbot labs Est. team will evaluate your project based on the criteria provided above and initiate the payout. Decisions will be made within a month of submission. Please be aware that there is no guarantee of a grant being paid out before your submission has been evaluated. Should your project lack quality and fail to meet the stated requirements, brainbot labs reserves the right to not pay out a grant.
